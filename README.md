# Swift Function Argument Error
This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift: forgetting to provide all required arguments when calling a function. The example shows a function to calculate the area of a rectangle. The error occurs when the function is called without providing a value for the 'width' parameter.  The compiler will produce an error in this scenario, highlighting the importance of providing all necessary inputs to a function.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that all required arguments are provided when calling the `calculateArea` function. The corrected code includes a width value.
